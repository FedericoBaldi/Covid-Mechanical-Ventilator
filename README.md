# Mechanical Ventilator porting
The thesis is about the porting of a user interface of a lung ventilator from Python to C++ by implementing an MVP architecture. The scope is to demonstrate the advantages of that design pattern and its application on a real product.
Be aware that is needed to have the MVM(Mechanical Ventilator Milano) project running and modified, you have to replace "datahandler.py" file with the one in the repository.
The "Tesi" document is in Italian.
